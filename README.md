# QuineMcCluskey-Method

Python is used in both the programs to implement the Quine McCluskey method.

+ **QM_Name:** Quine McCluskey method for 4 variables(A,B,C,D)
  - The user is prompted to enter their name.
  - The name is converted into its ASCII representation.
  - Unique ASCII values are stored as 'min_terms' and are sorted.
  - Quine-McCluskey method is used to find the minimized Sum of Products (SOP) expression from the unique minterms.

+ **QM_Minterms:** Quine McCluskey method for 6 variables(A,B,C,D,E,F)
  - The user is prompted to enter the min terms(0 to 63).
  - Quine-McCluskey method is used to find the minimized Sum of Products (SOP) expression from the unique minterms.

**NOTE:** 'don't cares' cannot be used in both the programs.
